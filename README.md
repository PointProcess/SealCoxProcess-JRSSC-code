<!-- File  | Description -->

<!-- ------------- | ------------- -->

<!--   simulation_script.R                         | This is the main script executing the simulation experiment in the paper. Settings for full simulation is commented out, such that the script can be ran quickly.  -->

<!-- timing_deterministic_integration_methods.R  | Script for timing the deterministic integration methods. -->

<!-- help_function.R | All functions used in the above scripts. Ufortunatly, almost no documentation is available.  -->
