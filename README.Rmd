# Data and code for the SealPupProduction JRSSC-paper
This repository contains a brief `R`-package associated with the paper *Estimating seal pup production in the Greenland Sea using Bayesian hierarchical modeling*, by
Martin Jullum, Thordis Thorarinsdottir and Fabian Bachl, accepted for publication in Journal of the Royal Statitsical
Society, Series C (Dec 2019). A preprint of the paper is currently available on 
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09254).

For any questions about the paper, code or data can be raised by opening a Github issue, or sending an email to the 
corresponding author [jullum@nr.no](<mailto:jullum@nr.no?subject=SealCoxProcess-JRSSC-code-Github>)

## Note

The original satellite image files are processed by scripts to be compatible with the functions in the package.
The original file is not that big, but the most detailed processed files are several hunder Mb. For this reason,
the largest files have not been processed. These can be processed by the script `inst\scripts\large_file_processing.R`.
These files are, however, not required to run the functions in the package with the default settings.
