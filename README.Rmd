# Data and code for the SealPupProduction JRSSC-paper
This repository contains a brief `R`-package associated with the paper *Estimating seal pup production in the Greenland Sea using Bayesian hierarchical modeling*, by
Martin Jullum, Thordis Thorarinsdottir and Fabian Bachl, accepted for publication in Journal of the Royal Statitsical
Society, Series C (Dec 2019). A preprint of the paper is currently available on 
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09254).

For any questions about the paper, code or data can be raised by opening a Github issue, or sending an email to the 
corresponding author [jullum@nr.no](<mailto:jullum@nr.no?subject=SealCoxProcess-JRSSC-code-Github>)

## Getting started

To get started using the package with the seal and satellite data in the paper, you first need to process them.
This is done running the scripts `inst\scripts\create_transect_data.R` and `inst\scripts\process_original_data.R` 
(in that order). Processing of the satellite data may take up to an hour or two.

<!-- File  | Description -->
<!-- ------------- | ------------- -->
<!--   simulation_script.R                         | This is the main script executing the simulation experiment in the paper. Settings for full simulation is commented out, such that the script can be ran quickly.  -->
<!-- timing_deterministic_integration_methods.R  | Script for timing the deterministic integration methods. -->
<!-- help_function.R | All functions used in the above scripts. Ufortunatly, almost no documentation is available.  -->
